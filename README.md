# KÃ¶rber Pharma Challenge Frontend (korber-challenge)
### Alexandra Maroco


As mentioned in my first interview, during my degree the contact I had with some of the mentioned/required front-end development tools was not only amateurish but also very specific. For instance, I only used React in a single project until now and that was a couple of years ago. Therefore, rather than looking up React's basics, I opted to check Vue.js - given that it's your preferred framework.

Determined to take the chance to learn the basics of Vue.js with this challenge, I followed a tutorial on YouTube (https://youtu.be/FXpIoQ_rT_c). Taking my time to make sure I understood what was happening, I got the chance to develop alongside the tutorial. In the end, I opted to attempt to build on top of it for this challenge. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to fulfil my goal of making that code more under the view I had for this challenge. Even so, I am choosing to leave here a tiny Google Slides with some rather simple prototypes of screens I wanted to try and create for this:

I appreciate any feedback you might want to give and want to thank you very much for the opportunity and thoughtfulness up until this point! :)
